In User Experience, it is essential to know that, how the user might intract with the product, how we should guide them and how the user's journey in the product might start and end.

- User Engagement, is a part of UX and tells how to connect with the user intrests, motivations and needs.

- Objective is that we make a simple, satisfactory and safe experience for the user.

- Useablity is a part of UX and tells that the product satisfies the needs of the user, and once we establish the useablity, we must make user aware of it and ensure them. One part of useablity is Navigation.

- Navigation is a guidence, we make user comfortable in knowing and showing how should they navigate through the product.

- Consistency is a part of UX and tells that the product is consistent in its design. We also have Error Prevention, which includes informative warns and errors in the user experience., so the user won't be confused about the product.

- Feedback is in user satisfaction, so if problems happened, they can help improve their product, and help us in better designs.

- Visaul Clarity is the part that, in the eyes of a user, how well and clear the design is.

- Flexibility is when we have different type of customers, and we must maintain and be flexible for any types of needs and intrest in our product.

User Interface is actually the part of "how should user intract with the logic and app". We Obviously don't want the user to know programming to have intraction with our app, so we make a reliable and good UI so the user can use it with ease.

- CLI (Command Line Interface) Is one of the types of UIs that enables the power for the user to intract with the app, OS and other types of product using the command line or terminal.

- GUI (Graphical User Interface) Is another interface the uses graphics to make an even better UI. In GUI we might have buttons, wizards, plain text, etc.

- TGUI (Touch Graphical User Interface) Is the interface that combines using the fingerprints and stylus, and the GUI, to make effective and good UI for the user, based on its own needs.

1. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">White space:</h3> There must be enough space between elements so the user can see and use them clearly and without headaches.

2. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">Colors:</h3> The color psychology of the product must be maintained, and is so important based on reasearch, you must know which colors wuit what and what other colors.

#### Some good tools for colors

   - [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
   - [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
   - [Canva - Colors](https://www.canva.com/colors/)
   - [Flat UI Colors 2](https://flatuicolors.com/)

3. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">Contrast:</h3> The contrast between the color of the text and the background must be maintained, and there is WCAG standard for it, that divides them in 2 levels: AAA, AA.

4. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">Visual Hirarchy:</h3> Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of graphic elements in a design in order of importance of each element. The visual weight defines the importance of an element in a design’s hierarchy, communicating to a viewer’s eyes what to focus on and in what order.

   ```brainfuck
   It has 6 principles; Reading patterns, Size matters, Space and texture, Typeface weight and pairing, Color and tint, Direction
   ```

5. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">Alignment:</h3>: Alignment makes a design look clean and polished. Different types of alignment are: Horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, Edge alignment, and optical alignment. Each of them also wrap into something new, for example in vertical alignment we have top alignment, bottom alignment or center alignment.

   ```brainfuck
   Important note about vertical and horizontal alignment: Vertical alignment happens when the content is orgeized in a way that their top, bottom or center is aligned on a _**horizontal**_, invisible line. Horizontal alignment is vise versa.
   ```

6. <h3 style="color: lightgreen; opacity: 0.8; font-size: 16px">Typography:</h3> Typography involves creating a complete, reusable typeface that allows you to make language visible.
